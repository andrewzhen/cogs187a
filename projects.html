        Quickly is a tool that enables students to download their class 
        schedules into their calendars instead of having to look it up on 
        their school websites or having to manually enter class start and end
        times, meetings each week, section id, and professor. <br><br>
        The tool works by converting data that is pulled from the school 
        system on a per-quarter basis into a calendar (.ics) file. Rest 
        assured, the logistical details are accurate for every class 
        successfully added since the range of possible classes are condensed 
        each time any option is selected in the dropdown menu. <br><br>Now, there's
        no excuse for not having a calendar to share with your friends and family.

        my Money is a finance tracker for all your expenses and assets 
        throughout the year. Simply tell the tool basic details such as the
        date of purchase, a brief description of it, the cost and
        finally, the category type. <br><br>
        Users have the ability to view based on academic year (e.g. 2018-19), 
        view all expenses and assets for that year, add a new purchase, 
        update a date, description, value or type, and delete any existing 
        purchase. Lastly, there is a helpful summary that tells you exactly
        how much you spent on each category, each academic quarter (including breaks), 
        each month of the year, and how much total.
